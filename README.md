# Handwritten Digit Prediction with MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates the process of building a machine learning model for handwritten digit prediction using the MNIST dataset. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately classify images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Overview

The MNIST dataset is a collection of grayscale images representing handwritten digits. The dataset contains a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images. Each image is a 28x28 pixel image of a single digit, and the goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the digit shown in each image.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow (>=2.0) or PyTorch (>=1.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/handwritten-digit-prediction.git
cd handwritten-digit-prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib tensorflow (or pytorch)
```

## Usage

1. Load the MNIST dataset and preprocess the data.
2. Build and train a machine learning model for handwritten digit prediction.
3. Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
4. Make predictions on new images.
5. Visualize the results and model predictions.

For detailed steps, refer to the code in the main project files.

## Results

After training and evaluating the model, you will see the accuracy achieved on the test set. You can also visualize the predictions made by the model on new images. Feel free to experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to achieve better results.
